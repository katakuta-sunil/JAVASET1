/*
 * pacakge is a just folder.
 * 
 * project contain different packages.
 * 
 * every project contain multiple  pacakges.
 * 
 * why we need pacakges?
 * to organise files systematically.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What are packages and their types?
Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, 
and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:
 Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API) User-defined Packages (create your own packages).
 * 
 * -----------------------------------
 * IN JAVA TWO TYPES OF PACAKES:
 * 1)BUILD IN PACKAGE: THE PACKAGES ALREADY THERE IN JAVA.  (package is nothing but folder).
 * 2)USER DEFINED PACAKGES: THE PACAKES ALREADY DEFINED BY THE USER.
 * 
 * 
 * java.util is also packae.

 *3) In method overloading, the return type can or can not be the same, 
 * but we just have to change the parameter.	
 * In method overriding, the return type must be the same or co-variant.

Dynamic binding is being used for overriding methods.

 * 5)Method overloading may or may not require inheritance.	
 * Method overriding always needs inheritance.

 * Method Overloading in Java
 * -----------------
Method Overloading is a Compile time polymorphism. In method overloading,
 more than one method shares the same method name with a different signature in the class. 
 In method overloading, the return type can or can not be the same, 
 but we have to change the parameter because, in java, we can not achieve method overloading 
 by changing only the return type of the method. 
 ----------------
 Method Overriding in Java
 -----------------------
Method Overriding is a type of runtime polymorphism.
 In method overriding, a method in a derived class has the same name, return type,
  and parameters as a method in its parent class. The derived class provides a 
  specific implementation for the method that is already defined in the parent class.
